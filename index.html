        Adidas, in full Adidas AG, German manufacturer of athletic shoes and
        apparel and sporting goods. In the early 21st century it was the largest
        sportswear manufacturer in Europe and the second largest (after Nike) in
        the world. Adidas products are traditionally marked with a three-stripe
        trademark, which remains an element in the company’s newer “trefoil” and
        “mountain” logos. Headquarters are in Herzogenaurach, Germany.

        Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern
        Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was
        documented before AD 100. In 962, the Kingdom of Germany formed the bulk
        of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German
        regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. Following the
        Napoleonic Wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806,
        the German Confederation was formed in 1815. Formal modern unification
        of Germany as a nation-state was commenced on 18 August 1866 with the
        North German Confederation Treaty establishing the Prussia-led North
        German Confederation later transformed in 1871 into the German Empire.
        After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Empire was
        replaced by the semi-presidential Weimar Republic. The Nazi seizure of
        power in 1933 led to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship,
        World War II, and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe
        and a period of Allied occupation, Germany was divided into the Federal
        Republic of Germany, generally known as West Germany, and the German
        Democratic Republic, East Germany. The Federal Republic of Germany was a
        founding member of the European Economic Community and the European
        Union, while the German Democratic Republic was a communist Eastern Bloc
        state and member of the Warsaw Pact. After the fall of communism, German
        reunification saw the former East German states join the Federal
        Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990—becoming a federal parliamentary
        republic.
